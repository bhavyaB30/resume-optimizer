Growth experiments end‑to‑end: ideate, build, launch, measure.
AI‑powered funnels: prototype flows that use OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, etc., to engage signups and convert free users into paid.
Automation & tooling: write scripts to identify & outreach to target accounts, track blog/social performance, A/B test landing pages.
Data wrangling: scrape usage metrics, assemble dashboards, run cohort analyses to find flywheels.
Creative hacking: anything from building a viral Twitter bot to more developer tools - if it moves the needle, you build it.

What you bring

You’ve shipped code in Python or TypeScript before
You’ve played with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, etc.) and know rate limits, cost tricks, prompt engineering, tool use etc
You think in metrics: you can spin up a quick dashboard, interpret a spike/drop, and act quickly
You’re hungry: no task is too small or too menial - if it helps us grow, you do it
Hacker mentality: you love shipping something in hours, not weeks, and iterating fast
Big Bonus if you’ve built bots, scrapers, or growth‑hack experiments before

Why Hyperbrowser?

High-leverage problems: reshape how AI agents browse the web.
